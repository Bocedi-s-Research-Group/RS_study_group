# RangeShifter Study Group
Solutions and shared code for the RangeShifter study group held at the University of Aberdeen.

Please don't commit large data files or figures to this repo, it would slow down pushing and pulling operations considerably.
You can upload them to the shared [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EV24VsNBm3zn3dis7wUmlVKo2euKvUFz?usp=drive_link) instead.

## Species distribution modelling
In preparation for RangeShifter inputs, we need to generate habitat suitability maps using species distribution models (SDMs).

### Homework this week
- Go through parts 1 and 2 of Damaris Zurell's [SDM tutorial](https://damariszurell.github.io/SDM-Intro/).
- Use the tutorial to get your own dataset from GBIF.
